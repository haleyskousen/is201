    <!--Describe Dragon relationship-->
    <p>I am a current full-time student at Brigham Young University studying pre-business as I prepare
        for the Accounting Program!  My previous experiences have taught me to value teamwork, integrity,
        community, and hard work.  The most important value in my life are my faith, my family, and
        my relationships with my community and others around me.  Many oportunities in my past have 
        allowed me to develop leadership qualities of communication, expectation, and service.
